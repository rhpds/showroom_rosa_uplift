= Canary deployment strategy

== Introduction

Applications have their own life cycle, so we should be able to execute independent canary deployment.
All the applications and dependencies will not change their version at the same time.

=== Canary deployment

In the intricate world of software deployment, we encounter a fascinating strategy known as the canary deployment.
Here, the operator introduces a new version of their application, but with a cautious approach.
Only a small fraction of the production traffic is allowed to interact with this untested version.
This select group serves as a vital testing ground, providing invaluable feedback on the new iteration.
Should the new version prove successful, the operator gradually increases the percentage of traffic, ultimately transitioning all users to this enhanced experience.
Unlike the more abrupt blue/green deployment method, canary deployments offer a gentler transition, ensuring that any potential failures are contained, minimizing their impact on the broader ecosystem.
Such is the elegance of this approach in the ever-evolving landscape of technology.
