= Declarative IaC for Automating VM Resources

== Introduction

One of the advantages of OpenShift and Kubernetes is that its configuration is managed with declarative YAML manifests.
The configuration of VMs running on OpenShift is the same.
In other systems, automating the creation of new virtual machine instances or managing the configuration of existing virtual machines often requires an understanding of complex IaC languages.

In this module you will increase the CPU resources dedicated to a VM using techniques easily adopted by any IaC system.

== Verifying Initial CPU Core Count

.  To find the VM to change, click on the left bar, *click Virtualization -> VirtualMachines*
On the top bar, select the *Project `windowsnetworking-{user}`*.

.  *Click on the `winweb01` VM*.
Notice the CPU | Memory section on the *Overview* tab.

. Verify the number of cores via powershell in the `winweb01` console.
.. Click on the *Console tab*, and click into the *black console box* to activate input into the VM console.
.. Start Powershell by *entering `15`* in the menu.

== Increasing CPU Core Count

. To increase the CPU core count via IaC, *click the YAML tab* and scroll down until you see `cpu`.
On approximately line 190, modify `cores` to increase the core count from *1 to 2*.
Click *Save*, and then click the *circular arrow* &circlearrowright; to restart the winweb01 VM.

.Changing the number of cores with a YAML edit

+
. Wait for the `winweb01` VM to restart.
. Verify the number of cores via Powershell in the `winweb01` console.
.. Click on the *Console* tab, and click into the black console box to activate input into the VM console.
.. As before, start Powershell by entering *15* in the menu.
.. To reveal the new number of cores, *Copy/Paste* the following command into the VM console with the Paste button.
+
[,powershell,subs="attributes",role=execute]

NOTE: You can also use Infrastructure as Code to trigger the necessary restart.
You could  implement a pipeline that reconfigures the virtual machine, then uses a Job running `virtctl` to restart the virtual machine.

[[congratulations]]
== Congratulations

You have increased the resources available to a virtual machine via Infrastructure as Code.
You can imagine from this example how you might automate the resource reconfiguration from a IaC tool, or from a pipeline.
