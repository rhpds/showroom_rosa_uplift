== Module 3: Declarative IaC for Automating VM Creation

Now let's show how we can use the YAML tab to automate the creation of a new VM.

. Go to your "windowsnetworking-{user}" namespace, on the left hand side click the "Virtualization" tab
. Click "VirtualMachines" and click on the winnetworking1 VM.
Copy all the YAML in the YAML tab.
. Click "VirtualMachines" then "Create" in the top right corner. Select "With YAML"
. Delete the pre-created YAML and paste the YAML template copied from winweb01.
. Search for "macAddress" and change the MAC address
. Search for "name: winweb01" (around line 41) and change it to winweb03
. Click "Create" and notice the new VM is created
