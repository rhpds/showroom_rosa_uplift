== Module 4: Simplified configuration for load balancing

In most systems, load balancing virtual machiness typically requires multiple different tools and configurations to work properly.
For example, to load balance two virtual machines internally and externally you might have to:

* [ ] Create a private internal load balancer
* [ ] Create an internet facing endpoint and route it to the internal load balancer
* [ ] Create private DNS records for the internal load balancer
* [ ] Create public DNS records for the public endpoint for external access
* [ ] Register virtual machines with the load balancer
* [ ] Configure the listening/forwarding port or port translation
* [ ] Configure health check endpoints and tests
* [ ] Configure health check timeouts and intervals

OpenShift trivializes networking and load balancing.
In this module, you'll accomplish all of this, without leaving OpenShift.

== Set up internal load balancing with Services

Services are internal load balancers in OpenShift.
Services route traffic to resources by identifing them with a label selector.
Labels can be applied to any OpenShift resources, including virtual machines,to identify and group them.
You will create a service and identify the virtual machines it services as a load balancer by means of labels on the virtual machines.

. On the left bar, click the *Virtualization -> VirtualMachines* and on the top bar select the *Project: `windowsnetworking-{user}`*
. To find the label on the virtual machine that will identify it to the Service for selection, *click on the `winweb01`* virtual machine.
*Click the YAML tab* and *search for "app: winnetworking"*.
It's usualy near line 186.
This is an arbitrary label assigned to both virtual machines.

+
. On the left side of the console, click to expand *Networking -> Services* and on the top right corner, click *Create Service*.
+
.Begin Service creation

+
. Modify the Service to load balance between virtual machines
.. On line 4, change the *name:* to `windowsnetworking`.
.. Modify line 8 to read `app: winnetworking`
.. Change the *targetPort:* value on line 12 to `80` then *click "Create"* in the bottom left corner
+
.Modify the Service configuration

+
. Click the *Pods tab* and notice that the two `winweb` virtual machines have already registered with the service object.
This will allow applications within the OpenShift cluster to access these virtual machines through the windowsnetworking Service, aka "load balancer".

== Set up external access to load balancing

OpenShift was the first to introduce the concept of Routes in the early days of Kubernetes.
Use a Route to provide external access to the virtuals machines through the internal Service, aka, load balancer.

. On the left side, Click *Networking -> Routes* and then click *Create Route*.
+
.Begin Route creation
image:module-4-create-route.png[Create Route,float="none",align="left"]
+
. Use the form to create the Route.
.. In the *name:* field put `windowsnetworking`.
.. Click the drop down box below *Service* and select the `windowsnetworking` Service you just created.
.. Click the drop down box below *Target port* and select port `80`.
.. Tick the *Secure Route* checkbox.
.. Under *TLS termination*, select `Edge`.
.. Under *Insecure traffic*, select `Redirect`.
.. Finally, click *Create* in the bottom left corner.
+
.Completed Route

+
. Test the Route.
In the middle right, find the *Location* section.
*Click the link to view your load balanced virtual machines.*
+
.Functioning application, accessed via the Internet

. A new browser window opens and accesses the web application.

=== Next Steps

Congratulations!
You've implemented internal load balancing through kubernetes Services, and accessed them via the Internet through OpenShift Routes.

Move on to the next module, where you will set up a Network Egress Firewall.
