= Network Egress Firewall

== Introduction

Security is important to every customer.
The principle of least privilege is a common security practice that limits an application's access to only those resources it needs to operate.
For example, if we know an application does not need access to the Internet, we should create a policy to block that application's access to the Internet.

In the real world, customers will solve this challenge with outbound proxies/VLANs/firewalls, but those solutions can be expensive and complex to implement.
Now we will show OpenShift Virtualization allows us to add an additional layer of security with just a few button clicks.

In this module, you will test blocking egress access from a Windows virtual machine to the Internet with the built-in, cloud native features of OpenShift.

[[access]]
== Access the Internet from a Windows virtual machine

. Click *VirtualMachines*, click *winweb01* then click the *Console tab*.
You are already logged into the windows virtual machine's administrative interface.
+
.Open the `winweb01` virtual machine console

. *Type `15`* and hit *Enter* to start Powershell
+
.Start PowerShell

+
. *Copy* the following command and *paste* it into the virtual machine console with the *special paste button*.
Click into the virtual machine console and hit *Enter*.
Notice that the connection succeeds with `StatusCode: 200`
+

----
curl google.com -UseBasicParsing -TimeoutSec 1 | findstr StatusCode
----
+
.PowerShell cURL success: `StatusCode: 200`

[[policy]]
== Implement a Network Policy to Block Egress

. On the left side, click *Networking -> NetworkPolicies -> Create NetworkPolicy*.
+
.Begin network policy creation
image::module-5-netpol-create.png[Create NetworkPolicy,link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
+
. Select the YAML View radio button.
+
.Use the YAML manifest to create the network policy
image::module-5-netpol-complete.png[NetworkPolicy Complete,link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
+
. Replace the sample YAML with the following NetworkPolicy.
+
[,yaml,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
 name: noegress
 namespace: windowsnetworking-{user}
spec:
 podSelector:
   matchLabels:
     app: winnetworking
 policyTypes:
   - Egress
----
+
. *Click Create* when your console looks as follows.

[[validate]]
== Validate that Internet Access is Blocked from the Windows virtual machine

. Go back to the Powershell and test the network connection to the Internet.
*Click Virtualization -> VirtualMachines -> winweb01 -> Console*
Click into the console and repeat the Internet access test.
*To run the same command again, press the Up Arrow and hit Enter*
+
.Failing the cURL Internet access test
image::module-5-powershell-curl-failure.png[Powershell cURL failure,link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
+
The egress to Internet connection has been denied with a timeout.

[[congratulations]]
== Congratulations

You have seen how easy it is to leverage cloud native resouces to implement a Network Egress Firewall.
