== Module 6: Istio Traffic Management

In the world of containers, service mesh (or Isitio more specifically) is considered one of the most desirable and transformational kubernetes features.
Whenever we talk about service mesh, it's in the context of words like *modernized*, *12 factor*, *SOA* and containerized apps - never with legacy virtual machines.

*UpLift and Shift* is about giving additional feature functionality without requiring rewriting or replatforming your applications.

Imagine the situation where a web application is running in Windows IIS and customers are reporting intermittent errors/latency.
What tooling exists for those legacy virtual machines to troubleshoot?

In this final section, we'll show how we can use the advanced network telemetry from Istio and Kiali to easily troubleshoot these issues with our legacy windows virtual machines.

=== Access Kiali

. Log in to the https://kiali-istio-sytem.apps.rosa-qkj6t.f3h3.p1.openshiftapps.com[Kiali web interface] with your username `{user}` and password `{password}`.
. Within Kiali, click *Services* on the left.
. From the *namespace* drop-down on the top bar, select your namespace: `windowsmesh-{user}`.
. Notice that we have a service called `winmesh`.
+

+
. *Click the `winmesh` service* - notice that there are two *workloads*, which are our virtual machines, `winweb01` and `winweb02`.
Though named similarly, these are different virtual machines from the earlier modules virtual machines.
They have OpenShift Service Mesh enabled, and are in a different Project/namespace.

+
. In the top right corner, click *Actions* and *Request Routing*
. Now examine the existing Request Routing configurations.
.. Click *Route To* and notice the two virtual machines are listed.
.. Notice that there's already a *Route Rule* to do 50/50 load balancing.
.. Click *Show Advanced Options* at the bottom.
Notice the *VirtualService Hosts* are prefixed with your username: {user}.

+
. Click *Gateways* and click *Add Gateway*. Click *Create Gateway* then click *Preview*.

+
In the Preview popup window you'll see the DestinationRule and VirtualServices.
The DestinationRule indicates which resources will be part of the VirtualService.
The VirtualService indicates what percentage of traffic is routed to each of the destinations.

+
. There's no need to change any of the settings, so just click *Cancel*.
. Click *Graph* on the left side.
. Click the *Display* drop-down box
.. Tick *Response Time* to see request latency.
.. Tick *Throughput* checkbox to see data transfer rate.
.. Tick *Traffic Distribution* checkbox to view load balancing percentage.
.. Tick *Traffic Rate* checkbox to see how many requests per second are being sent
.. Tick *Traffic Animation* checkbox to see little dots representing individual requests.
+

. Notice the panel on the right side that shows request response code (200, 300, 400, 500s)

Zoom in and out of the graph to see traffic details.

== Conclusion

The Cloud Native features already present in OpenShift provide a far most robust and complete platform than competing platforms.

We hope this workshop has helped you understand the UpLift and Shift vision, and how you can get far more than simple replatforming when your new platform is OpenShift.
