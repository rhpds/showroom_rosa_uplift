= Dashboards: Operators, Multi-Tenancy, and Resource Utilization

== Introduction

Red Hat OpenShift for AWS (ROSA) is a robust, extensible, multi-tenant, and richely informative platform for applications.

ROSA is OpenShift, enjoying a rich ecosystem of Operators.
Operators offer easy-to-manage installations of layered products on top of OpenShift.
Red Hat offers dozens of fully-supported products through the Operator Catalogs.
The number of available operators increases to the hundreds through our Partner Catalogs, all certified by Red Hat.

Multi-tenancy in OpenShift is easy to manage, and based on 10+ years of collaboration with the wider Kubernetes community.
Projects (aka Namespaces) are the core of this capability.

In this workshop you, and all the other participants, have dedicated OpenShift users all on the same ROSA cluster.
Your OpenShift user will have full access to two namespaces dedicated to your virtual machines and applications.
Your OpenShift user also has limited permissions in some other namespaces, to facilitate information gathering and networking data transit.

The OpenShift dashboards are robust and configurable gathering points for all aspects of the cluster - especially the virtual machines running on the cluster.
Let's take some time now to review those dashboards.

== Accessing the System

Your workshop environment is on a shared ROSA cluster.
Other participants in this workshop are also on this cluster, so you have limited access to the behind-the-scenes workings of OpenShift.
Where important features of OpenShift are not visible to your user, this Workshop Guide will offer explanations and screenshots of the relevatnt parts.
This tight user access control shows off the powerful multi-tenancy of OpenShift.
Many projects can run on a single OpenShift cluster, and not interfere with each other.

You'll be doing this whole workshop through the OpenShift Console.

TIP: If you're on an ordinary laptop, the workshop experience is best done at full-screen.  The OpenShift Console is a robust interface, and you'll have the best experience in full screen mode.  Switch between these instructions and the OpenShift Console as you progress through these instructions.

. *Click the {openshift_console_url}[OpenShift Console^]*.
A new browser tab will open.
. ROSA offers optional integreation with Amazon Cognito, an identity platform for web and mobile apps.
*Click Cognito*.

. *Enter your username `{user}` and password `{password}`*.
. By default you will be taken to the Developer perspective.
Change to the Administrator perspective.
*Click the drop-down menu on the upper left, and select Administrator*.

Congratulations!
You're now logged in and ready to begin the workshop!

== Review the Operators

=== The OpenShift Virtualization Operator

The OpenShift Virualization operator enables OpenShift to host virtual machines and creates the "Virtualization" tab in the OpenShift console.
It can be installed simply through the Operator Hub.

The OpenShift Virtualization has already been deployed for you.
Examine the configuration as follows.

. Navigate to the Installed Operators page, and find the virtualization operator.
Click the Virtualization Operator to examine its custom resources and APIs.

== The Migration Toolkit for Virtualization

The Migration Toolkit for Virtualization operator creates the "Migration" tab in the OpenShift console.
This is where you connect to the VMware cluster you want to migrate VMs from (providers) and create the migration jobs (plans).

. Go back to the *Installed Opeartors* page and search for `Migration`.
Examine the Migration Toolkit for Virtualization Operator.
The toolkit has already been deployed for you.

[[resourceutilization]]
== Resource Utilization

It may seem trivial, but capturing utilization metrics from all VMs isn't simple, particularly in the cloud.
OpenShift makes this easy by automatically generating these dashboards for every VM you run on OpenShift.
The resource metrics are stored in a time series database allowing the user to view utilization at various points in time and is exportable if the customer wishes to view the metrics in their own dashboards.

. View your list of virtual machines in the windowsnetworking-{user} project.
On the left bar, *click Virtualization -> VirtualMachines*.
Then *select Project: `windowsnetworking-{user}`* from the top bar.

. *Click on the winweb01* VM to see an Overview of a VM.
+

+
*Click the "Metrics" tab* to see the resource utilization information for this VM.
