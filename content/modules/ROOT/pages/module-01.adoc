== Module 1: Resource Utilization Dashboards

It may seem trivial, but capturing utilization metrics from all VMs isn’t simple, particularly in the cloud. 
OpenShift makes this easy by automatically generating these dashboards for every VM you run on OpenShift. 
The resource metrics are stored in a time series database allowing the user to view utilization at various points in time and is exportable if the Customer wishes to view the metrics in their own dashboards.
